## How to use locally

In the project directory, you need to use command:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Next step

 * Use Typescript (to avoid propTypes use)
 * Pagination: (use next_cursor to display next values)
 * Internationalization (manage multiple languages)
 * Add tests : I'm aware that my test on the component Trip is not very useful, I started implementing tests with react-testing-library but I wasn't able to make them work during my time
